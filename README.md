# Dapp: Payments Web3
This is a project based on [boilerplate-react-metamask](https://github.com/jaavier/boilerplate-react-metamask/), a project that help us to connect React with Metamask

- By default this project will be connected to Sepolia testnet.
- Feel free to try this dApp and create a request of payment to this wallet 0xd823Ff0182d87666e8e1eDFb4287Fd99FbDaD8C8 for an amount of 0.0012 ETH. 

📣⚠️ This dApp works just in Testnet Sepolia! 📣⚠️

I'll be attent :)
